# Intro to the web

## Learning objectives

### Goals for the week

Ask yourself the same two questions:

- Are you having fun?

- Are you a better developer than you were yesterday?

#### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

- **Can you build a web app?**

### Reminder of all this week's goals from the [Week Outlines](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md)

By the end of the week all developers can:

* Build a simple web app (this primary goal breaks down into the sub-goals below)
* Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
* Explain the MVC pattern

### Concepts and skills for the week

#### Concepts

- The relationship between a client and a server.
- How HTTP is used to send information over the web.
- RESTful APIs.
- The request/response cycle.
- Web templating with HTML/CSS.

#### Skills

- Debugging programs that use multiple languages.
- Using a framework (Sinatra) in your code.
- Structuring the code for apps that have user interaction and visual output.
- Testing apps that have user interaction and visual output.
- Tracing data between the browser and server.

## Structure of the challenges

- Some exercises to get you familiar with Requests, Responses, and HTTP
- A project to get you familiar with Servers, `params`, `session`s
- Some exercises to get you familiar with Capybara
- An extended project to wrap it all together
